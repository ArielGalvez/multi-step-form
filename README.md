## My process

- Layout the mockups using mobile fist
- Adap the components to desktop view using media-queries
- Integrate the compoenents with formkik
- Add validations with yup and integrate with formik
- Handle pricings
- Refactor code
- Describe solution
- Configure CI/CD with github actions

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - programming languaje
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - For styles `still pure CSS`

### What I learned

I wanted to practice my CSS skills and build something by using mockups. And the same time Im training a friend and told him that I will build something that he can use as an example.
Lately, I have been using only component frameworks libraries such as material-ui, chakra-ui and others, so I wanted to remember how it tastes to build our custom components with React.
I don't feel comfortable explaining how it was, but I'm pretty sure you won't find `any` in the whole code.
Something that I feel proud is the layout, they are the same components. just resizing using media-queries.

### Continued development

I would like to have another complex design to implement, on my free time as part of my hoobies I like implement figma designs using html+css.
Maybe in the future I will go for React Native.
